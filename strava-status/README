A display of my recent cycling activity, built into an IKEA picture frame: distance, number of rides, time, achievements, elevation gain.

The electronics consists of an ESP8266 "ESP-03" WiFi module, WS2812 RGB LEDs, a DC/DC converter for the 3.3V of the ESP,  NFET to put LEDs to low power, reset button and 4 rechargeable AA batteries. The batteries will last a few months.

The ESP8266 runs Lua via the NodeMCU firmware:
