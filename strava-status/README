STRAVA sports summary display
Youtube video: https://youtu.be/bHk8gPNdcJg

A display of my recent cycling activity, built into an IKEA picture frame: distance, number of rides, time, achievements, elevation gain.

The electronics consists of an ESP8266 "ESP-03" WiFi module, WS2812 RGB LEDs, a DC/DC converter for the 3.3V of the ESP,  NFET to put LEDs to low power, reset button and 4 rechargeable AA batteries. The batteries will last a few months.

The ESP8266 runs Lua via the NodeMCU firmware:

http://nodemcu-build.com/

The Lua scripts and pre-build firmware is here:

The STRAVA API is used to get the activity summary info as JSON from a STRAVA account:

Because the ESP does not support TLS 1.2 but the STRAVA API demands it, Thingspeak ThingHTTP is used to give HTTP access. To avoid a security problem, only the activity summary is tunneld by ThingHTTP:
